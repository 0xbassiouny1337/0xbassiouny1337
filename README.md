About Me
ðŸŽ“ I am an 19-year-old driven individual with a deep passion for cyber security. Since the age of 16, I have been exploring the fascinating world of web security, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge.

ðŸ’¼ Currently, I work as a Web Penetration Tester and Bug Hunter, focusing on securing web applications and conducting vulnerability assessments. My skillset includes PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and Python for web development.

ðŸ”’ Beyond web security, I am deeply interested in OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and malware development. I believe in the power of information and its impact on securing digital systems.

ðŸ“š Here are some of the courses I have completed:

eWPT (eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Testing)
eJPTv2 (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)
eWPTX (eLearnSecurity Web Exploitation Extreme)
eCPPT 
OSCP
